# Scoundrel Game Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Scoundrel is a solo roguelike dungeon crawler card game that we're implementing as a full-stack application with future AI and blockchain integration. This implementation plan focuses on a simplified approach to get the core functionality working quickly.

## Key Implementation Components

### 1. Card and Deck Models âœ…

The card and deck models are the foundation of the game:

- Cards have suit, rank, and value
- Cards are categorized as monsters (clubs/spades), weapons (diamonds), or potions (hearts)
- Deck contains 44 cards (52 minus 8 red face cards and aces)
- Deck supports drawing cards and shuffling

### 2. Player Model âœ…

The player model tracks:

- Current and maximum health (starts at 20)
- Currently equipped weapon
- Monsters defeated by the current weapon
- Potion usage flag for the current room

### 3. Room Mechanics âœ…

Room implementation handles:

- 4 cards per room
- Playing 3 cards in player-chosen order
- Tracking the remaining card for the next room
- Handling room completion

### 4. Combat System âœ…

The combat system implements:

- Monster damage calculation
- Weapon usage against monsters (with option to fight barehanded)
- Weapon restrictions (can only be used against monsters with lower value than previously defeated monsters)
- Health tracking and game-over detection

### 5. Simple REST API âœ…

The API provides endpoints for:

- Creating a new game
- Getting current game state
- Playing a card
- Optional: Skipping a room

### 6. Web Frontend ðŸ”„

The web frontend will include:

- Card visualization with appropriate styling
- Game board layout showing current room
- Player status display (health, weapon, etc.)
- Interactive controls for playing cards and making decisions
- Visual feedback for game events

## Testing Strategy

Our testing approach focuses on core functionality first:

1. Unit tests for game models and rules âœ…
2. API tests for endpoints âœ…
3. Manual testing through CLI âœ…
4. End-to-end testing with frontend (upcoming)

## Tradeoffs Made for Simplicity

1. Consolidated directory structure with fewer packages âœ…
2. Combined related code into fewer, larger files âœ…
3. Simple REST API without WebSockets initially âœ…
4. Focus on core unit tests with more manual testing âœ…
5. Delayed implementation of advanced features âœ…

## Next Steps After Frontend Implementation

1. AI player implementation
2. Performance optimization
3. Blockchain integration
4. Advanced game features and variations

## Development Tools

### Makefile

```makefile
.PHONY: run test build

run:
	go run cmd/api/main.go

test:
	go test ./...

build:
	go build -o bin/scoundrel-api cmd/api/main.go
```

## Future Expansion Areas

   - Added test cases to verify correct win detection

4. **Health Cap Implementation** âœ…

   - Added clear documentation about the health cap rule
   - Fixed tests to account for health cap

5. **Room Skipping Enhancement** âœ…
   - Added validation to prevent skipping after cards have been played
   - Updated CLI to only show skip option when applicable
   - Added error messages to clarify skip restrictions

## Frontend Implementation Plan

For the web frontend, we'll take a progressive approach:

1. **Basic HTML/CSS Layout**
   - Create the game board structure
   - Style cards for each type (monster, weapon, potion)
   - Design health and status indicators

2. **Card Visualization**
   - Render cards with appropriate suit and rank
   - Add visual differentiation for card types
   - Create a discard pile area

3. **Game State Management**
   - Connect to the API to retrieve game state
   - Maintain local state for smooth interaction
   - Handle game state transitions

4. **User Interactions**
   - Implement card selection
   - Create UI for weapon choice when fighting monsters
   - Add room skipping controls

5. **Visual Feedback**
   - Add animations for card play
   - Create visual effects for combat
   - Provide feedback for healing and weapon equipping

## Questions for Further Development

1. How complex should the frontend be initially? Basic HTML/JS or a full React application?
2. Should we implement real-time updates via WebSockets after the basic frontend is working?
3. Are there any additional game mechanics or rules you'd like to implement beyond the core rules?
4. How should we approach the AI implementation after the frontend is complete?
