You raise excellent points about Scoundrel being single-player and the potential benefits of an event system. Let me clarify both aspects:

## Concurrency in a Single-Player Game

You're right that each individual Scoundrel game is single-player. The thread safety concerns aren't about multiple players affecting the same game state, but rather:

1. **Multiple Sessions**: Your backend is designed to support many concurrent game sessions (different players playing their own separate games simultaneously)

2. **API Concurrency**: In a web service, multiple HTTP requests can hit your endpoints at the same time:
   ```
   Player A: GET /games/123/state  ←┐ 
   Player B: POST /games/456/play   | These could happen
   Player C: POST /games/create     | simultaneously
   Player A: POST /games/123/skip  ←┘
   ```

3. **AI Training**: The most significant concurrency will come from your AI training system, where you might simulate thousands of games simultaneously to train models efficiently

The `mutex` in your `SessionManager` isn't protecting individual games from concurrent modification (which wouldn't happen), but ensuring the sessions map itself can be safely accessed from multiple goroutines.

## Event Emission Pattern

An event system would be perfect for leaderboards and more! Here's how you could implement it:

```go
// GameEvent represents an event that occurred during gameplay
type GameEvent struct {
    SessionID  string
    PlayerID   string
    EventType  string
    Timestamp  time.Time
    Data       map[string]interface{}
}

// EventEmitter publishes game events
type EventEmitter struct {
    listeners map[string][]func(GameEvent)
    mutex     sync.RWMutex
}

// NewEventEmitter creates a new event emitter
func NewEventEmitter() *EventEmitter {
    return &EventEmitter{
        listeners: make(map[string][]func(GameEvent)),
    }
}

// Subscribe registers a listener for specific event types
func (ee *EventEmitter) Subscribe(eventType string, listener func(GameEvent)) {
    ee.mutex.Lock()
    defer ee.mutex.Unlock()
    
    ee.listeners[eventType] = append(ee.listeners[eventType], listener)
}

// Emit publishes an event to all relevant listeners
func (ee *EventEmitter) Emit(event GameEvent) {
    ee.mutex.RLock()
    defer ee.mutex.RUnlock()
    
    // Call all listeners for this event type
    for _, listener := range ee.listeners[event.EventType] {
        go listener(event)  // Run asynchronously
    }
    
    // Also call "all" event listeners
    for _, listener := range ee.listeners["all"] {
        go listener(event)
    }
}
```

Then integrate it with your `GameSession`:

```go
// Add to GameSession struct
type GameSession struct {
    // existing fields...
    events *EventEmitter
}

// In NewGameSession()
func NewGameSession() *GameSession {
    // existing code...
    session.events = NewEventEmitter()
    return session
}

// Example of emitting events
func (g *GameSession) PlayCard(index int) error {
    // existing code...
    
    // Emit event after playing card
    g.events.Emit(GameEvent{
        SessionID:  g.ID,
        EventType:  "card_played",
        Timestamp:  time.Now(),
        Data: map[string]interface{}{
            "card":       card,
            "room_cards": g.currentRoom.Cards(),
            "health":     g.player.Health(),
        },
    })
    
    return nil
}
```

## Benefits of Event System for Your Project

1. **Leaderboards**: Events like "game_completed" can update leaderboards:
   ```go
   emitter.Subscribe("game_completed", func(e GameEvent) {
       if e.Data["victory"].(bool) {
           // Update leaderboard with victory stats
           leaderboard.AddEntry(e.PlayerID, e.Data["turns"].(int), e.Data["health"].(int))
       }
   })
   ```

2. **AI Training**: Collect detailed gameplay data:
   ```go
   emitter.Subscribe("all", func(e GameEvent) {
       // Store all events for AI training
       trainingDB.SaveEvent(e)
   })
   ```

3. **Analytics**: Track which cards and strategies are most effective:
   ```go
   emitter.Subscribe("monster_defeated", func(e GameEvent) {
       // Record weapon performance
       weaponStats.IncrementVictory(e.Data["weapon"].(string), e.Data["monster"].(string))
   })
   ```

4. **Replay System**: Record complete game history for playback:
   ```go
   var gameHistory []GameEvent
   
   emitter.Subscribe("all", func(e GameEvent) {
       if e.SessionID == targetGameID {
           gameHistory = append(gameHistory, e)
       }
   })
   ```

5. **Real-time Spectating**: Let people watch AI games as they happen:
   ```go
   emitter.Subscribe("all", func(e GameEvent) {
       if spectators[e.SessionID] != nil {
           for client := range spectators[e.SessionID] {
               client.Send(e)  // WebSocket broadcast
           }
       }
   })
   ```

This event system integrates perfectly with your existing code while providing a clean, extensible way to build all the features you mentioned (leaderboards, statistics tracking, replay functionality) without tightly coupling those features to your core game logic.

Would you like me to expand on any specific aspect of the event system implementation or show how to adapt your existing code to use it?
